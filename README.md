# github-search-graphql-auth-proxy
A simple proxy server for [this client](https://github.com/lu4ezar/github-search-graphql).  
It just adds auth token to client request and passes it further to github api ([v4](https://developer.github.com/v4/)) endpoint, then returns it back to the client.
That's it.
